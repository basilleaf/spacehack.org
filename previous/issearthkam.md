<p>A NASA education program that provides unique, high quality photographs of our planet taken by middle school students. Using the web to direct a digital camera on space flights and the International Space Station, select middle schools request images based upon their classroom investigations. Teachers, school administrators, and other youth organization leaders are allowed to sign up for <a href="http://www.earthkam.ucsd.edu/index.shtml">ISS EarthKAM</a> with their group of students.</p>
<p>The program enables students, teachers and the public to learn about Earth from the unique perspective of space. The image collection and accompanying learning guides and activities are extraordinary <a href="http://www.earthkam.ucsd.edu/public/educators/index.shtml">resources to support classes</a> in Earth science, space science, geography, social studies, mathematics, communications and even art. Since the program&#8217;s inception in 1996, the ISS EarthKAM camera has flown on five Space Shuttle flights and taken almost 5000 images. Currently, the camera resides on the International Space Station.</p>
