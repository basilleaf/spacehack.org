<p>Be an astronaut on a mission to Mars for four months! A research program is seeking participants for a simulated Mars mission, taking place in 2013 in Hawaii. The Hawaii Mars Analogue Mission and Food Study is designed to simulate the living, eating and working experience of astronauts on a real planetary mission.</p>
<p>Six prime and two alternate crew members will be selected to participate in:<br />
  a four day workshop at Cornell University (summer 2012)<br />
  a two week training mission (late 2012)<br />
  a four month mission simulation (early 2013)</p>
<p>The training and simulated missions will involve living and working together in a small isolated Mars analogue habitat in a Mars-like environment, having only delayed electronic communication with the outside world. Participants will wear simulated spacesuits whenever leaving the habitat, respect water restrictions and consume &#8220;instant&#8221; and shelf-stable foods.</p>
