<p>A stepped program of robotic missions that seek to return mankind to the lunar surface, and to do it in such a way that it is accessible to everyone. The Open Luna Foundation is open source and invites <a href="http://www.openluna.org/wiki/index.php/People_needed">everyone</a> (hardware providers, writers, wiki-editors, designers, etc.) to contribute and share what you want to do and what science you would like to see done on their wiki. One of their specific aims is to reach out to the community and educational systems to spread interest, enthusiasm, and involvement.</p>
<p>Following these purely robotic missions, a short series of manned missions will construct a small, approximately 6 person settlement based on a location scouted by the robotic missions. This settlement will be open for anyone&#8217;s use (private individuals to government agencies), provided they respect the ethical conduct and heritage policies. Currently, most of the work on the missions is being done on the wiki.</p>
