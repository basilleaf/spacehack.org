<em><small>COMPASS-1 CubeSat</small></em></p>
<p>Ever dreamed of being able to launch something into space? Through Citizens In Space, you could be one step closer to making that dream a reality. The project has an open call for experiments that could be launched on board a CubeSat, a type of small satellite. There&#8217;s room for approximately 100 of these small experiments which are expected to launch by 2014 via <a href="http://www.xcor.com/">XCOR</a>&#8216;s Lynx rocketplane. From conducting astrobiology experiments to searching for new space phenomena, the sky (or in this case, the edge of space), is the limit!</p>
<p>Citizens In Space will also be awarding a $10,000 prize for an experiment that qualifies for their <a title="High Altitude Astrobiology Challenge" href="http://www.citizensinspace.org/astrobiology-challenge/" target="_blank">High Altitude Astrobiology Challenge</a> and a $5,000 prize for the best non-astrobiology-related experiment. All experiments must be licensed as open source hardware &#8211; the use of readily-available &#8220;closed-source&#8221; components is allowed, but you must provide enough documentation for others to reproduce the hardware. Experiments will be exposed to microgravity and cosmic radiation, so plan accordingly. <strong>If you&#8217;re interested in submitting an experiment to Citizens In Space, send a notice of intent to <a href="mailto:experiments@rocketacademy.org?subject=Notice%20of%20Intent">experiments@rocketacademy.org</a> as soon as possible.</strong> Citizens in Space is a project of the United States Rocket Academy.</p>
