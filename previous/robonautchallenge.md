<p>A challenge to hack one of NASA&#8217;s robots in space. The NASA Robonaut Challenge tasks developers with tinkering Robonaut 2, NASA&#8217;s robot that lives on the International Space Station (ISS). In this <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/ntl">NASA Tournament Lab</a> challenge, robotics and computer vision enthusiasts will be helping train <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robonaut#Robonaut_2">Robonaut 2</a>.</p>
<p>Robonaut 2 needs to learn how to interact with the types of input devices the astronauts use on the ISS. NASA has built several taskboards for Robonaut to play with. The taskboards have a number of LEDs that turn on when the power switch is flipped or the buttons are pushed. In these challenges, competitors will write algorithms in C++ to control Robonaut 2 and teach it how to interact with the taskboard.</p>
<p>This is the first of 2 challenges for Robonaut 2 hackers: the second contest will ask competitors to use the  seeing  algorithm produced in the first challenge in order to write an algorithm that actually controls the robot s motion. There is $10,000 USD in total prize money. Registration for the first &#8220;vision&#8221; challenge closes April 22nd.</p>
