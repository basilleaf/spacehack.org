<p>A project that allows individuals or groups to dedicate some portion of their time to analyzing data taken with other people&#8217;s telescopes. The Global Telescope Network is a network of small telescopes around the world for the purpose of supporting the science of NASA and ESA high energy astrophysics missions, including XMM-Newton, Swift and GLAST. These missions are designed to study astronomical objects through their emission of x-rays and gamma rays. However, much can be learned by combining observations over a broad range in the electromagnetic spectrum. The GTN has been assembled to make observations in the optical that will compliment the observations done at higher energies by space-borne observatories.</p>
