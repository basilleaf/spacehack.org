<p>The annual <a href="http://moonbuggy.msfc.nasa.gov/index.html">Great Moonbuggy Race</a> will be held April 17-18, 2015 in Huntsville, Alabama, at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center. Participating students will design a vehicle that addresses a series of engineering problems that are similar to problems faced by the original Moonbuggy team.</p>
<p>Each Moonbuggy will be human powered and carry two students, one female and one male, over a half-mile simulated lunar terrain course including &#8220;craters&#8221;, rocks, &#8220;lava&#8221; ridges, inclines and &#8220;lunar&#8221; soil.</p>
<p>Moonbuggy entries are expected to be of &#8220;proof-of-concept&#8221; and engineering test model nature, rather than final production models. Each student team of six members is responsible for building their own buggy, and the course drivers, who are chosen from each team, must also be builders of the vehicle.</p>
