<small><em>Asimov, Part-Time Scientists&#8217; entry for the Google Lunar X PRIZE</em></small></p>
<p>A competition to create innovative energy storage for lunar rovers to use during their 14-day-long lunar night. Energy storage solutions will be tested in temperatures as low as -177 Celsius and as high as 25 Celsius. Phase 2 of the competition will also expose energy storage solutions to low pressures in addition to low temperatures. The Night Rover Challenge is part of <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/index.html">NASA&#8217;s Centennial Challenges</a> series that aims to create advanced technologies for space exploration.</p>
<p>Competition trials for the Night Rover Challenge will be conducted at NASA&#8217;s Glenn Research Center (GRC) Plumbrook Station located in Sandusky, Ohio. Prizes for winning solutions range from $50,000 to $500,000. The competition is open to international participants, but is only able to award prizes to U.S. citizens. Please note that there is a $3000-$5000 USD registration fee associated with this competition.</p>
