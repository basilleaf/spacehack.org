<p>The <a href="http://astronaut-glove.us">2009 Astronaut Glove Challenge</a> is designed to promote the development of glove joint technology, resulting in a highly dexterous and flexible glove that can be used by astronauts over long periods of time for space or planetary surface excursions.</p>
<p>The challenge is conducted by Volanz Aerospace Inc. in a format that brings all competitors to a single location for a &#8220;head to head&#8221; competition to determine the winning team(s). Each team is required pass a series of minimum performance requirements and perform a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>For the 2009 Challenge, teams must provide a complete glove, which consists of the thermal micrometeoroid garment (TMG), unpowered bladder and bladder-restraint portion of the space suit that covers the hand of an astronaut up to and including the wrist joint. Prizes will be awarded for overall First Place and Second Place in the challenge, and the winner of the Joint Force Test. Prizes provided by <a href="http://centennialchallenges.nasa.gov/index.htm">NASA Centennial Challenges Program</a>. Team Agreement, prize information and competition dates will be announced at a later time.</p>
