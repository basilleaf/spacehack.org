<small><em>mockup of the Orion spacecraft</em></small></p>
<p>NASA is asking high school students in the U.S. to research and help design new ways to protect astronauts from space radiation.  As NASA begins to map out ways for humans to explore asteroids and Mars, they need to develop ways to protect astronauts from radiation during these distant travels. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(spacecraft)">Orion spacecraft</a> is NASA&#8217;s next generation of crew modules to help put humans into space, eventually carrying them beyond the Earth&#8217;s orbit and on to Mars.</p>
<p>The competition challenges students to follow an engineering design process and work in teams to design radiation shielding to protect a sensor on the Orion crew module from space radiation. Once designs have been completed, teams may compete for the chance to build their design and have it flown on the Orion Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1). The flight test scheduled for 2014 will take Orion farther into space than any manned spacecraft has been since the Apollo missions, giving scientists and engineers a chance to study the effects of radiation on humans beyond low Earth orbit. Teams&#8217; designs and prototypes will be judged by NASA and Lockheed Martin researchers, educators and graduate engineering students. Five teams will be selected for the test phase of the challenge.</p>
