<p>Mentoring and inquirY using NASA Data for Atmospheric and earth science for Teachers and Amateurs (<a href="http://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov">MY NASA DATA</a>) is a project to enable K-12 teachers and students, as well as citizen scientists, to explore the large volumes of data that NASA collects about the Earth from space. A main goal of the MY NASA DATA project is to remove the barriers (such as file size and format, and complicated computer tools) that prevent the use of authentic NASA Earth System Science data in the classroom or by the interested public.</p>
<p>Students use scientific inquiry and math skills as they access and display microsets of the Earth System. A microset is a small amount of data &#8211; perhaps a single parameter for the whole globe; or a time series for a single location &#8211; extracted from a much larger data file. It is in a simple format, such as plain text, or accessible through a user-friendly tool. In addition to the microsets, the MY NASA DATA website offers a collection of lesson plans to help you get started with data exploration.</p>
<p>How to participate:<br />
* Use the <a href="http://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/data.html">Live Access Server</a> to discover data to help teach concepts in your curriculum<br />
* <a href="http://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/registration.php">Contribute a lesson plan</a> you develop or submit student projects<br />
* Interact in the <a href="http://mynasadata.larc.nasa.gov/mentor.php">e-Mentor network</a><br />
* <a href="mailto:mynasadata@lists.nasa.gov">Give feedback</a> on the website, lesson plans, data microsets and tools</p>
