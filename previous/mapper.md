<p>Help NASA find life on Mars by exploring microbialites in the lakes of British Columbia. Microbialites are rocks that are influenced by microbes when they formed. Microbialites are rare on Earth today, but were the only forms of life on Earth for the first billion years of its history. Scientists think that by learning more about microbialites here on Earth, we&#8217;ll have a better idea of where to search for life in outer space. By exploring and tagging the locations of these microbialites, you&#8217;re helping part of the scientific search for signs of life on Mars and other planets.</p>
<p>The work you do filters into the NASA <a href="http://www.pavilionlake.com/">Pavilion Lake Research Project</a> (PLRP) that investigates underwater environments to learn more about microbialites. By being a Mapper participant, you&#8217;re joining forces with NASA, the Canadian Space Agency, and universities from around the world to work together on the PLRP. In addition to classifying the images, you&#8217;re encouraged to record notes to alert the PLRP team about interesting or odd things that may be transpiring in them. Once this iteration of the Mapper project is complete, a queryable, interactive map will be available online so that contributors and PLRP scientists can investigate the lakes by testing hypotheses about how microbialite formation is affected by a variety of factors (depth, light, location, etc.).</p>
