<p>Contribute to the scientific understanding of the surfaces of solar system bodies. Surface features help astronomers learn more about solar system bodies. Developing the critical eye needed to identify and measure surface features in images takes a considerable amount of practice. Clickworkers offers you the opporunity to fine-tune your skills. The Clickworkers program presents a series of images from which you can identify and measure the diameter of craters on two solar system bodies (Mars, Eros).</p>
<p>Once you have submitted your crater counts for Eros using the Clickworkers program, the resulting data will be analyzed by the science community. The accumulated measurements of many people provides an accurate measure of the number and size of craters on a body. This information contains clues to the age and impact history of the body&#8217;s surface.</p>
