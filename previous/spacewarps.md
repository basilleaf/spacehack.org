<p>Go hunting for rare warps in space-time, also known as gravitational lenses! Massive galaxies have the ability to create gravitational lenses by warping space-time around themselves; bending light rays so that we can see other galactic objects that lie behind them. In a way, gravitational lenses act as a natural telescope &#8211; allowing people to see magnified, yet distorted, distant galaxies that otherwise would be difficult to see with conventional telescopes.</p>
<p>Observing these distant galaxies through a gravitational lens can help expand knowledge about how they form stars and grow over time. Additionally, by studying gravitational lenses, people can map out where dark matter exists in the universe and how clumpy/dense it is near the center of galaxies. All of this equates to providing crucial information about how galaxies evolve.<br />
