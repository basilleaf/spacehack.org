<p>A community that provides distributed computing power to aerospace research projects that might not otherwise have access to supercomputers due to financial, administrative or bureaucratic reasons. By volunteering a percentage of your computer s unused operating power, your computer will focus on a variety of tasks from modeling the Moon&#8217;s surface to simulating various spacecraft, thus expediting fundamental and applicable research.</p>
<p>The combined power of all volunteering users will help to solve important scientific tasks for both students and professionals in fields from astronomy to aerospace engineering. The bottom line is to benefit from the generosity of the volunteers and to benefit from the accumulation of different projects, like sharing programming knowledge in distributed computing and influencing the others&#8217; simulation by its own solutions.</p>
<p>The Constellation platform uses BOINC (Berkeley Open Interface for Network Computing) and is an open space for anyone who is an air and space enthusiast that wants to donate idle computing time or even skill for a sub-project on platform. Get in touch with the Constellation project coordinators if you need computing power for your own simulation.</p>
