<p>A non-profit scientific, educational project whose objective is to bring the excitement of observing natural and man-made radio waves to high school students. Underlying this objective is the conviction that science and technology are the underpinnings of our modern society, and that only with an understanding of science and technology can people make correct decisions in their lives, public, professional, and private. INSPIRE (Interactive NASA Space Physics Ionosphere Radio Experiment) also is an innovative, unique opportunity for students to actively gather data that might be used in a basic research project. The <a href="http://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/inspire/">INSPIRE project</a> uses build-it-yourself kits to measure and record VLF emissions such as tweeks, whistlers, sferics, and chorus along with man-made emissions.</p>
