<p>A project where you can help create a better understanding of how the Milky Way evolves over time and potentially make new unexpected scientific discoveries. The Milky Way Project aims to sort and measure our galaxy and the characteristics of its cold, dusty material that is so important to creating stars.</p>
<p>The project calls on people to find bubbles, star clusters and unusual characteristics in infrared images acquired from the Spitzer Space Telescope. These bubbles (or clouds) are part of the life cycle of stars &#8211; often containing several hundred to several thousand young stars. Some bubbles have already been found by a study that inspired this project. By finding more bubbles, you can help map star formation in the Milky Way. As well as bubbles, knots and stars clusters there are other objects hidden throughout these images such as young stars, supernova remnants and never-before-seen galaxies. If you see anything unusual in the images, make sure to mark it using the &#8216;areas&#8217; tool. The hope is to map out these objects and then use your discoveries to make more observations. You might even discover something we didn&#8217;t expect.</p>
<p>Soon, the next update to the Milky Way Project will involve hunting for young stellar objects in similar data.</p>

Citizen scientists discover more than 5,000 bubbles, creating a much-improved catalog to be published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-16534434">Read about it</a>.</p>
