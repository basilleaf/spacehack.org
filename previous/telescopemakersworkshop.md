<p>Open to all ages and free to attend, the Telescope Makers  Workshop is an all-volunteer group committed to helping people build their own telescopes. Bring your interest and curiosity, and they&#8217;ll provide knowledge, enthusiasm, and advice to help you complete your telescope-making projects. No experience necessary.</p>
<p>You will be expected to buy your own materials, including a mirror blank, a grinding tool, a rinse bucket, a spray bottle and paper towels. The workshop carries a small stock of mirror kits for sale at cost, and we can provide you with the names of other sources. The typical 8 -diameter telescope mirror blank and tool cost under $150. A completed 8  telescope on a wooden Dobsonian mount can be built for under $300, compared to $400 &#8211; $900 for a commercially-made one.</p>
<p>The Telescope Makers  Workshop is held every Friday night from 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., excluding major holidays that fall on Fridays. The Workshop is always closed on Memorial Day Weekend. Attendance every Friday night is not mandatory, and members work at their own pace. The Workshop meets in its new quarters in California at the new Chabot Space &amp; Science Center, 10000 Skyline Blvd., Oakland.</p>
