Take your own picture of Mars using a spacecraft currently orbiting the planet. The Mars Student Imaging Project invites students to design a research question, use real mission tools to operate the <a href="http://spaceprob.es/2001marsodyssey/">2001 Mars Odyssey</a> spacecraft's camera, and then analyze the captured image and data to make new scientific discoveries. The project is open to U.S. students in grades 5 through to college sophomore level, with the accompaniment of an adult facilitator. In some circumstances, students in countries outside the U.S. can participate by partnering with a U.S. school.
