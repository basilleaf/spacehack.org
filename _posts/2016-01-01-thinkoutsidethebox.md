Design a clever expandable 3D printed object that will help astronauts living in microgravity aboard the International Space Station. The 3D printer on the International Space Station is limited in size, so coming up with creative designs for objects that can be printed within a small space but expand (or assemble) into larger objects will be very useful. The competition is open to K-12 students in the United States. The deadline to participate in the Think Outside the Box competition is August 1, 2016.
