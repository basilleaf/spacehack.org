Discover entirely new comets by searching through spacecraft data. Comets are essentially dirty ice balls or icy dirt balls in space that emit an atmosphere or tail as they heat up while passing near a star. To date, only a small fraction of the comets in our solar system have been discovered. Sungrazer is a NASA-funded project that invites everyone to comb through the data of the SOHO and STEREO spacecrafts to discover previously unknown comets.
