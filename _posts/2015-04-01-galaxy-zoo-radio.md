Help astronomers discover supermassive black holes. In order to better understand how supermassive black holes form and evolve over time, astronomers need to observe many of them at different stages of their lifecycles. To do this, they need your help to find them! With a large enough sample (from your classifications),  black holes can be found at different stages and astronomers can build a better picture of their origins.

Black holes are found at the center of most, if not all, galaxies. These supermassive black holes drag in nearby material, growing to billions of times the mass of our Sun and occasionally producing spectacular jets of material traveling nearly as fast as the speed of light. The jets of material spewed out by these supermassive black holes can’t be detected in visible light, but can be observed in the radio wavelengths. There is a great deal of valuable information that can be obtained from the radio images of these jets. There’s also a need to understand the host galaxy, which can be critical to understanding how big and how luminous the black hole actually is.
