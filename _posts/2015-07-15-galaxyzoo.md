Help improve knowledge of how galaxies form through classifying them and maybe even discovering new ones along the way. There are as many as one hundred billion galaxies in the universe. By classifying the shapes of galaxies, we can learn a lot about their history and the future of the universe. Through Galaxy Zoo, participants have not only contributed to valuable research, but they've also been co-discoverers of galaxies and cosmic phenomenons. Galaxy Zoo welcomes participants worldwide.
