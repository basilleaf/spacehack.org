By donating your computer’s idle time, you can help particle physicists study the nature of dark matter, antimatter and mass in our universe. By contributing spare processing capacity on your computer, people are able to run simulations of beam dynamics and particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider’s giant detectors. Particle accelerators like the LHC help study the nature of the universe by creating conditions in the accelerator here on Earth that might otherwise only take place in a supernova, black hole, or the start of the Big Bang.
