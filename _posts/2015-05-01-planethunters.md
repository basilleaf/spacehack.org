Help discover new exoplanets by combing through data captured by the NASA space telescope, Kepler. Exoplanet is  short for extrasolar planet, meaning planets around stars other than our own Sun. When an exoplanet travels in front of a star, Kepler is able to see a dip in the star's brightness. Humans are often better than computers at finding distinct patterns in data and thus are able to find exoplanets that may have been overlooked by computers. Planet Hunters is open to participants worldwide. If you help discover a new exoplanet, you'll be invited to be a co-author on the discovery paper submitted for publication.
