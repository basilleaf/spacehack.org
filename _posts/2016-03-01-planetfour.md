Explore the surface of Mars and help create the first large scale measurement of wind on the planet. By marking "fans" and "blotches" in images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), you can help create a better understanding of Mars' climate, as well as reveal clues to the wind speeds experienced on the surface. Planet Four invites volunteers from around the world to collectively look for clues in the Martian surface.
