Digitize the astronomical logbooks of the Harvard Computers, a group of women who famously revolutionized star classification and astronomy at large. Recently, 2000 journals, notebooks, and logbooks written by early astronomers at the Harvard College Observatory spanning from the mid-1800s to the mid-1900s have been rediscovered. By helping <a href="https://transcription.si.edu/browse?filter=owner:11">transcribe these logbooks</a> digitally, you'll be helping make them free, searchable, and openly accessible to anyone via HOLLIS (Harvardâ€™s catalog) and the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS).
