Help scientists understand how the Sun's magnetic activity affects the Earth through classifying the complexities of sunspots. Through classifying images of sunspots, people can more accurately predict solar eruptions that have the potential to harm astronauts, damage satellites and disrupt the electrical grid. Sunspotter is open to people of all ages around the world.
