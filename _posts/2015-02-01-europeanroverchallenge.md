Design, construct, and operate a Mars rover as part of an international challenge. As Mars continues to be a horizon goal for human exploration, there is increased focus on creating the next generation of rovers that will explore Mars in clever new ways for the years to come. The European Rover Challenge is open to university-level students and faculty worldwide and is typically held each September in Poland. A letter of intent to participate in the competition is typically due in March each year.
