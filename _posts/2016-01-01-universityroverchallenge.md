Design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that could one day work alongside astronauts. There is more than one way for a rover to traverse the Martian surface and perform a variety of tasks. For example, people have prototyped rovers that are more akin to tumbleweeds than automobiles. The University Rover Challenge is open to university-level students worldwide and is typically held in May or June each year in Utah. High school students can be included in a university team. The deadline for team registration is usually in December or January each year.
