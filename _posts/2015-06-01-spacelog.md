Help create a web version of early human spaceflight transcripts that have only been in print version until now. Spacelog aims to bring the memorable moments of some the first humans in space to life by making them easily searchable and linkable on the web. Volunteers can transcribe missions, write new material (biographies, descriptions of key moments and phases, and so on), select images for use in the missions, and/or develop the source code further.
