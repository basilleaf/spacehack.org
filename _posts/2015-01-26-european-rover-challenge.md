An international competition for university-level students/faculty to design, construct and operate a Mars rover. The competition challenges teams to create a Mars rover that can accomplish tasks in sample retrieval, “blind” terrain traversal, life support maintenance, and emergency repairs. Teams must design and build their own rover, but are allowed to use off-the-shelf components. A letter of intent to participate in the competition is typically due in March each year.
