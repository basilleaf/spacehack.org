An international competition for university-level students/faculty to design, construct and operate a Mars rover. The competition challenges teams to create a Mars rover that can accomplish tasks in sample retrieval, “blind” terrain traversal, life support maintenance, and emergency repairs. Teams must design and build their own rover, but are allowed to use off-the-shelf components. A letter of intent to participate in the competition is typically due in March each year.

Rovers are limited to costing no more than 15,000 EUR in parts, equipment and paid services. The competition is usually held each September in Podzamcze, Poland. The European Rover Challenge is is a modified version of the University Rover Challenge and is organized by the European Space Foundation and Planet PR Agency, and partners with the Mars Society Polska.
