A Mars analog research program led by the Austrian Space Forum (OEWF), a volunteer space organization based in Austria. The PolAres program aims to develop strategies for human-robotic interactions in preparation for a future human-robotic Mars surface expedition. The Austrian Space Forum collaborates with international partners, space professionals, space enthusiasts and interdisciplinary volunteers to help accomplish the goals of the PolAres program. The PolAres programâ€™s vision is to provide a profound impact on the efforts to prepare for the exploration of the Solar System, by both helping to enable a Human Mars Mission through stimulating public awareness and testing out concepts and technologies that might help making such a mission safer and more effective.
