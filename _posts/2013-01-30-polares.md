A Mars analog research program led by the Austrian Space Forum (OEWF), a volunteer space organization based in Austria. The PolAres program aims to develop strategies for human-robotic interactions in preparation for a future human-robotic Mars surface expedition. The Austrian Space Forum collaborates with international partners, space professionals, space enthusiasts and interdisciplinary volunteers to help accomplish the goals of the PolAres program. The PolAres program’s vision is to provide a profound impact on the efforts to prepare for the exploration of the Solar System, by both helping to enable a Human Mars Mission through stimulating public awareness and testing out concepts and technologies that might help making such a mission safer and more effective.

The PolAres program’s approach has been mapped out into four steps: “During four consecutive years, the interaction between analogue astronauts and an advanced robotic component will be investigated. The programme shall follow a staggered approach: First, a scouting phase shall identify possible Mars analogue sites in Europe and the neighbouring Arctic. In a second step, a stratospheric/mesospheric balloon shall be constructed and launched both as a training project and as a precursor for the Rover phase (phase 3). In a synergetic approach, hardware components like sensors and navigation elements shall be tested before being implemented on the Rover, which shall form the core of phase 3. In a fourth step (phase 4) the man-machine interface between the rover and the analogue astronaut shall be tested, including interactivity requirements development and investigation.”
