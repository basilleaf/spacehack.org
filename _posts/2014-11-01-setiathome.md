Contribute to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence by donating your computer's idle time to analyzing radio telescope data. The broad search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) looks for both optical and radio signals that could not occur naturally, thus suggesting evidence of extraterrestrial technology. SETI@home looks through noise in radio telescopes for such signals. Anyone with an internet-connected computer can participate in SETI@home and collaborate with its online community.
