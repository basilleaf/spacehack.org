Discover entirely new comets by searching through spacecraft data. Comets are small icy Solar System bodies that heat up when passing close to the sun, displaying a visible atmosphere and sometimes a tail. Only a small fraction of the comets in our Solar System have been discovered. The Sungrazer Project is a NASA-funded program where you can discover previously unknown comets in SOHO and STEREO satellite data. Anyone can join this project, all you need is an internet connection and some free time.
