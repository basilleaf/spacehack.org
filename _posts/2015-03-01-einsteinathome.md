Contribute to the search for gravitational waves and discover new neutron stars (also known as pulsars). Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime itself caused by astronomical events and celestial bodies, as predicted by Albert Einstein in his General Theory of Relativity. In 2015, the first direct detection of gravitational waves was achieved by a laser-based observatory on Earth. The astronomical event of two black holes colliding created this first detectable gravitational wave. Further detection of gravitational waves is expected to usher in a new era of astronomy. Einstein@Home uses your computer’s idle time to search for gravitational waves and provides an active online community to collaborate with.
