Discover supermassive black holes and along th way help astronomers learn how and why they often form in the center of most galaxies. By making observations of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in radio and infrared wavelengths, more data can be created, making ever more accurate models of how supermassive black holes work. Galaxy Zoo Radio invites people of all ages around the world to participate in making new discoveries and collectively contribute to new research.
