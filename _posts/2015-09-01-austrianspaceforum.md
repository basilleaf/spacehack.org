Help generate interdisciplinary research that will aid humans in landing on Mars. Many countries and organizations want to send humans to Mars, but no matter who ends up going, a large body of research on the challenges of exploring Mars will be of great value to the humans who make the trip. The Austrian Space Forum invites people around the world and across all disciplines (be they lawyers, writers, coders, artists, researchers, etc.) to approach them about ways in which they may be able to volunteer to help. The projects under the Austrian Space Forum vary over time, but they often focus on developing strategies for human-robotic interactions, stimulating public awareness, and testing out concepts and technologies that might help make a Mars mission safe and more effective.
