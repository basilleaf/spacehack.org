Design a map to help future astronauts navigate Mars. The first human mission to land on Mars will need to conduct surface operations and analysis of interesting Martian features, while avoiding potentially hazardous areas. The competition asks for participants to not create simply a geologic map, but rather a product that can be used by the astronauts during their approximately one-year long mission. The Mars Exploration Zone Map Design Competition is open to participants worldwide to apply by September 1, 2016.
